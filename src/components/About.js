      <h1>About the Museums</h1>
      <p>
        Ever since their founding, the Harvard Art Museums—the Fogg Museum,
        Busch-Reisinger Museum, and Arthur M. Sackler Museum—have been dedicated
        to advancing and supporting learning at Harvard University, in the local
        community, and around the world. The museums have played a leading role
        in the development of art history, conservation, and conservation
        science, and in the evolution of the art museum as an institution.
        Through research, teaching, professional training, and public education,
        the museums strive to advance the understanding and appreciation of art.
        Programs encourage close looking at original works of art, collaboration
        with campus and community partners, and the production of new
        scholarship.
